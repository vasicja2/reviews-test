3;2;-1.0;30.0;-1.0;-1.0;The student often uses the same symbols in different meanings.
4;2;35.0;-1.0;-1.0;-1.0;For example, the chapter __ concerns mostly __, while it was expected that this chapter would be focused on __.
4;2;30.0;-1.0;-1.0;-1.0;However, the chapter __ consist only of __ and I miss __.
4;2;40.0;-1.0;-1.0;-1.0;Structuring of the chapter __ is not appropriate.
5;2;50.0;50.0;-1.0;-1.0;There are small deficiencies with the definitions and the consistent use of defined terms.

6;2;50.0;-1.0;-1.0;-1.0;As for the logical structure --- the thesis could be better organized and structured.
7;1;70.0;35.0;35.0;35.0;The structuring of this thesis is relatively good, but there are many drawbacks.

9;2;-1.0;-1.0;90.0;-1.0;The language used is formal, but simple and easy to understand.
9;2;-1.0;-1.0;85.0;-1.0;The language level is good considering the fact that this is most likely the first larger work the student had to write in English.
10;1;-1.0;-1.0;100.0;-1.0;The author's level of English is beyond expectations.
10;1;-1.0;-1.0;100.0;-1.0;The language of the thesis, being in English, is extremely good for a non-native speaker.
11;1;65.0;-1.0;70.0;50.0;The formal level of this thesis is adequate, although the typography could be improved.
12;2;-1.0;-1.0;-1.0;30.0;Although English is not the native language of the student and mistakes are expected, there are many typos which could have been easily filtered by the use of a spellchecker.
12;2;-1.0;-1.0;-1.0;30.0;The way of referencing to bibliography is inconsistent.

17;2;-1.0;-1.0;50.0;55.0;There are minor grammatical errors (mostly __).
18;2;75.0;-1.0;50.0;55.0;However, these mistakes do not affect the general readability of the text.
19;1;40.0;-1.0;35.0;35.0;The formal level of the thesis was expected to be far better.
19;1;40.0;-1.0;35.0;35.0;There are many issues to work on and I do not provide a complete list, just several examples:
19;2;35.0;-1.0;30.0;30.0;These formal issues devaluate achieved results as well as the thesis itself.

21;2;-1.0;-1.0;-1.0;55.0;A few typos have been detected, however, they do not influence the quality of the thesis.

26;1;-1.0;15.0;-1.0;-1.0;I found significant differencies in usage of defined terms.
26;1;-1.0;10.0;-1.0;-1.0;Many of the used terms were never defined.
27;1;-1.0;90.0;-1.0;-1.0;All of the terms were properly defined before usage.
28;1;5.0;-1.0;-1.0;-1.0;Chosen structuring makes the text very hard to read and comprehend.
