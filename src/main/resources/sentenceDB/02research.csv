13;1;-1.0;-1.0;-1.0;100.0;-1.0;The text references the relevant documents on __. 
13;2;-1.0;-1.0;-1.0;100.0;-1.0;Consequently, I find this to be a very complete and accurate bibliography.

16;2;-1.0;-1.0;-1.0;30.0;-1.0;__ is not a good source for an academic publication.
17;2;-1.0;-1.0;90.0;80.0;-1.0;The majority of this bibliography was brought in by the student, independently.
18;1;70.0;-1.0;-1.0;-1.0;-1.0;The resulting text is shorter than usual, however __.
19;1;-1.0;-1.0;-1.0;75.0;75.0;The student's activity in acquisition and use of studying materials was slightly above the average.

25;1;-1.0;-1.0;90.0;90.0;-1.0;The student did a great job identifying and discussing related work.
25;1;-1.0;-1.0;90.0;95.0;-1.0;The student has covered and surveyed a number of technologies, consistently finding resources and references addressing the state of the art in those technologies.
26;1;-1.0;-1.0;80.0;95.0;-1.0;Excellent work with different sources of literature for all parts of the thesis.
