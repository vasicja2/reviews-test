12;2;-1.0;-1.0;-1.0;-1.0;50.0;References could be used a bit more often.

13;1;-1.0;-1.0;-1.0;100.0;-1.0;The text references the relevant documents on __. 
13;2;-1.0;-1.0;-1.0;100.0;-1.0;Consequently, I find this to be a very complete and accurate bibliography.

17;2;-1.0;-1.0;90.0;80.0;-1.0;The majority of this bibliography was brought in by the student, independently.
18;1;70.0;-1.0;-1.0;-1.0;-1.0;The resulting text is shorter than usual, however __.
19;1;-1.0;-1.0;-1.0;75.0;75.0;The student's activity in acquisition and use of studying materials was slightly above the average.
